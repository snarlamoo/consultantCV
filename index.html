            <h3><span>//</span>About me</h3>
            <p>Hi, I am currently learning to become a web developer at codenation.</p>
            <p>I have over 10 years experience working in the advertising and publishing industries.
                I have worked in several roles during this time, from a creative designer for the 
                advertising agency that branded Liverpool for the 2008 Capital of Culture, to 
                various production roles working for Reach PLC, the largest newspaper publisher
                in the UK.
            </p>

            <!-- content for IT in modern business -->
            <div id="IT"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>IT in modern business</h3>
            <p>The role of IT in the modern business has become as diverse as it is essential to the 
                smooth running of a company's information infrastructure. Whether it's using technology
                to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data or information, the IT professional must
                have these requirements to enable business users to carry out their roles efficiently, productively and securely.
            </p>

            <!-- content for digital projects -->
            <div id="digital_projects"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Digital projects: methods</h3>
            <h4>Skills and resources need to complete digital projects sucessfully</h4>
            <p>There are many qualities an IT professional needs to complete a digital project sucessfully. 
                The ability to identify the projects goals and ambitions from the beginning are crucial 
                to shaping the direction of the project. In terms of creating a website for a client, a good
                start would be to ask simple questions such as: what kind of website does it need to be? And who
                is the target audience?
            </p>

            <h4>Further skills and qualities include:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate</li>
                <li>Attention to detail and problem solving</li>
                <li>Strong organisational skills with the ability to multi-task and prioritise</li>
                <li>The ability to continually asses and review results throughout the life of the project, and make necessary changes when needed</li>
                <li>Technologically savvy enough to be aware of the best tools and resources to complete a project sucessfully. In terms of web development, this 
                    wold include a good working knowledge of the languages of the web: html, css, and Javascript
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- content for planning tasks -->
            <div id="planning"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Planning a digital project</h3>
            <p>When planning a digital project such as a website, it's best that the process is broken down into smaller sections.</p>
            <p>After first establishing what kind of website you're trying to make, what you want the site to do, and who the intended audience is, there are important 
                considerations. It is a good idea to collate all the content for the website first. This can be done in a planning and 
                content management system such as Trello. This will help to understand the scale of information that needs to be included, and how 
                that information will be organised in the website.</p>
            <p>Next could be coming up with a visual style for the site. It could be a good idea to research similar sites on the web, and again
                using Trello, visual elements and ideas can be attached to sections to form a mood board for the site.</p>
            <p>When you know what type of site you want to create, who it's for, and then what the visual style of the site will be, 
                you can then start looking at the developing code to realise the website from a collection of ideas and visuals into 
                a working prototype.
            </p>

            <!-- content for digital project risks -->
            <div id="risks"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Digital project risks</h3>
            <p>Risks that might impact a digital projects can come from not taking the time to plan the website, defining its goals and what you want
                to achieve from the start. This can result in getting deep into the development of the project and resulting with a website that 
                the client is not happy with. There are also time and budget constraints, and these are good to be defined from the beginning 
                of the project to help identify any limitations that could hinder the project further down the line.
            </p>

            <!-- choosing technology -->
            <div id="software"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
            <p>Choosing the appropriate IT systems and software is an important consideration. Again, it's vital to establish this from the initial
                planning stage to find answers regarding the projects scale, the audience, and the client's needs. After establishing these answers, we 
                can start to consider the technology and software that would be beneficial. For example, a small local retailer would not require
                the same development to the back end of the website as a major retailer. In this instance, a smaller shopping facility on the website
                would probably be more appropriate to this project.
            </p>



            <!-- analysis and outcomes -->
            <div id="analysis"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Analysis and outcomes</h3>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Alias mollitia repellendus quas aspernatur? Nobis aliquam nihil quod maxime vitae, 
                fuga doloribus quos, quidem dolor ullam officia quae, id ipsum dolorem.
            </p>


            <!-- GDPR and digital projects -->
            <div id="gdpr"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>GDPR and digital projects</h3>
            <p>GDPR, which came into force on May 25th 2018, is a new set of laws that affect individuals, organisations, and companies that are either
            controllers or processors of personal data. This will impact the type of personal information that can be collected by an organisation, and 
            will allow people to have easier access to data held about them.</p>
            <p>In addition to how long for, and the type of information collected, organisations will now have to obtain consent of people they 
                collect information about. This is important as regulators can fine businesses that don't comply with the new GDPR regulations.
