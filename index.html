            <h3><span>//</span>About me</h3>
            <p>Hi, I am currently learning to become a web developer at codenation.</p>
            <p>
                I have over 10 years experience working in the advertising and publishing industries. 
                I have worked in several roles during this time, from a creative designer for the advertising agency 
                that branded Liverpool for the 2008 Capital of Culture, to various production roles working for Reach PLC, 
                the largest newspaper publisher in the UK.
            </p>

            <!-- content for IT in modern business -->
            <div id="IT"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>IT in modern business</h3>
            <p>
                The role of IT in the modern business has become as diverse as it is essential to the smooth running of 
                a company's information infrastructure. Whether it's using technology to store, retrieve, transmit and 
                manipulate data or information, the IT professional must have these requirements to enable business users 
                to carry out their roles efficiently, productively and securely.
            </p>

            <!-- content for digital projects -->
            <div id="digital_projects"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Digital projects: methods</h3>
            <h4>Skills and resources need to complete digital projects successfully</h4>
            <p>
                    There are many qualities an IT professional needs to complete a digital project successfully. 
                    The ability to identify the project's goals and ambitions from the beginning is crucial to shaping 
                    the direction of the project. In terms of creating a website for a client, a good start would be to 
                    sk simple questions such as: what kind of website does it need to be? And who is the target audience?
            </p>

            <h4>Further skills and qualities include:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate</li>
                <li>Attention to detail and problem solving</li>
                <li>Strong organisational skills with the ability to multi-task and prioritise</li>
                <li>The ability to continually asses and review results throughout the life of the project, and make necessary changes when needed</li>
                <li>Technologically savvy enough to be aware of the best tools and resources to complete a project sucessfully. In terms of web development, this 
                    wold include a good working knowledge of the languages of the web: html, css, and Javascript
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- content for planning tasks -->
            <div id="planning"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Planning a digital project</h3>
            <p>When planning a digital project such as a website, it's best that the process is broken down into smaller sections.</p>
            <p>
                After first establishing what kind of website you're trying to make, what you want the site to do, and who the intended 
                audience is, there are important considerations. It is a good idea to collate all the content for the website first. 
                This can be done in a planning and content management system such as Trello. This will help to understand the scale of 
                information that needs to be included, and how that information will be organised on the website.</p>
            <p>
                Next could be coming up with a visual style for the site. It could be a good idea to research similar sites on the web, 
                and again using Trello, visual elements and ideas can be attached to sections to form a mood board for the site.</p>
            <p>
                When you know what type of site you want to create, who it's for, and then what the visual style of the site will be, 
                you can then start looking at the developing code to realise the website from a collection of ideas and visuals into 
                a working prototype.
            </p>

            <!-- content for digital project risks -->
            <div id="risks"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Digital project risks</h3>
            <p>
                Risks that might impact digital projects can come from not taking the time to plan the website, defining its goals 
                and what you want to achieve from the start. This can result in getting deep into the development of the project 
                and resulting in a website that the client is not happy with. There are also time and budget constraints, and these 
                are good to be defined from the beginning of the project to help identify any limitations that could hinder the project 
                further down the line.
            </p>

            <!-- choosing technology -->
            <div id="software"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
            <p>
                Choosing the appropriate IT systems and software is an important consideration. Again, it's vital to establish this from 
                the initial planning stage to find answers regarding the projects scale, the audience, and the client's needs. After establishing 
                these answers, we can start to consider the technology and software that would be beneficial. For example, a small local retailer 
                would not require the same development to the back end of the website as a major retailer. In this instance, a smaller shopping 
                facility on the website would probably be more appropriate for this project.
            </p>


            <!-- analysis and outcomes -->
            <div id="analysis"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>Analysis and outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                After deciding on the content, and how I wanted to present it visually, I was then able to answer the question as to what 
                would be the most appropriate web technology I could use to create it.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the initial planning stages, it was beneficial to have used Trello to plan out the site and to collate content. 
                Using this process, I was better able to understand the scale of the website I was creating, and this informed how the 
                information would be visually presented. By creating content at the beginning that was separate from the coding process, 
                I could restructure information and add ideas without committing any of it in code, which would be more difficult to do 
                later in the process. Trello was also useful to make notes of other websites that I wanted to use as inspiration, and also 
                to collate any visual elements I wanted to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the website was quite simple in style and function, I decided that it was most appropriate to use CSS and HTML to 
                create it. Although javascript could have been an option for some elements, such as changing the appearance of links 
                as the cursor hovered over them, etc,. I knew that this function was also achievable using just CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create the code, I decided to use VS code and also set up a repository using GIT. This would enable me to keep track 
                of my changes, and also to have access to the code when working on the website from home. This factor has been beneficial 
                in allowing me to solve problems away from the curriculum at codenation. 
            </p>


            <!-- GDPR and digital projects -->
            <div id="gdpr"></div>
            <h3><span>//</span>GDPR and digital projects</h3>
            <p>
                GDPR, which came into force on May 25th 2018, is a new set of laws that affect individuals, organisations, and companies 
                that are either controllers or processors of personal data. This will impact the type of personal information that can be 
                collected by an organisation and will allow people to have easier access to data held about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to how long for and the type of information collected, organisations will now have to obtain the consent of 
                people they collect information about. This is important as regulators can fine businesses that don't comply with the new GDPR regulations.
